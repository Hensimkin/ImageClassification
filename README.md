# Image Classification Project

Welcome to the **Image Classification Project**! This project implements two AI methods for classifying images:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

## ðŸ“– Overview

This project explores image classification techniques using both deep learning and traditional machine learning methods. By leveraging CNNs and SVMs, it provides a comparative analysis of their performance on image datasets.

### Key Features

- **CNN Implementation**: Utilizes convolutional neural networks for end-to-end image classification.
- **SVM Implementation**: Applies support vector machines with feature extraction for classification.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes normalization, augmentation, and resizing of images.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Provides graphical representations of training progress and confusion matrices.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The primary goals of this project are to:

- **Understand AI Techniques**: Gain hands-on experience with CNNs and SVMs in image classification tasks.
- **Compare Models**: Analyze the effectiveness of deep learning versus traditional machine learning methods.
- **Enhance Skills**: Improve proficiency in Python, machine learning frameworks, and data preprocessing.
